| Term | Definition |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| Block | A part of an orchard used for differentiating fruit types for various reasons. Blocks are between 0.1 and generally much less than 10Ha. Each block must be homologous (ie.e a single variety, age etc) |
| BRIX | Measure of the sugar content in the fruit |
| CTP | (Clearance To Pick) Paper document that Packhouses generate to enable picking of specific Maturity Areas. CTP can only be generated if a Maturity Area has a valid Cleared Sample Request for that season AND a valid RF residue sample.|
| Dispensation rules | Rules that define maturity areas (how big they can be etc) and which of those rules can be broken (with a dispensation) |
| Dry matter | The solid component of the fruit without the water component. Dry matter is calculated by the TSP - weighing a slice of the fruit (wet) then drying that in an oven to determine the quantity of dry matter vs water |
| Kiwistart | Different criteria are applied to the beginning of the season. This criteria is called Kiwistart - timing determined by the Fruit Quality Manager at Zespri. As all early fruit will be sold immediately and not stored, there is no concern about pressures so this is excluded from the metrics. (Kiwistart rules require seed count, but not pressure) |
| KPIN | (Kiwifruit Property Identification Number) A unique 4-digit identifier for an orchard |
| Mainpack | Everything not the beginning of the season (pressure is important but not seed count as seeds are generally all black at this point) |
| Maturity Area | A grouping of blocks on an orchard with similar characteristics for the purpose of sampling (Residue, Clearance, Monitoring). Each MA is made up of blocks from a single variety of fruit, similar age, growing method etc |
| Maturity Clearance System (MCS) | The webapp developed by Qrious to ensure the end-to-end process of kiwifruit maturity clearance testing and results is always available, always accurate and fully within the control of Zespri, not a third party. Zespri can be sure through MCS that it is meeting the standards expected of it as the market world leader in kiwifruit. |
| Orchard | Place where kiwifruit is grown; same as KPIN, except orchards are names and KPINs are unique numbers |
| Packhouse | Storage facility for kiwifruit, also the organisation that monitors the fruit quality, organises the CTP, organises the picking and packing of the fruit, receives payment from Zespri and passes payment to the grower |
| Sample Request | A request for collecting and testing of fruit in a specific MA. Different SR types consist of different quantities of fruit (eg Clearance = 96 of which 90 are kept). SR also encompasses the results that come back for a specific SR.<ul><li> Clearance SR is to understand the maturity of the fruit and the best time for picking</li><li>Monitoring SR is for Zespri internal use</li><li>Residue SR is for some markets that require no spray substance leftovers in fruit</li>
| Season Rollover | The process of rolling over the previous production season to the current production season (e.g. 2022 to 2023). This is done on a per-country basis as every country's dates of harvest differ. This affects the UI primarily in season-constrained components, i.e.<ul><li>The KPIN and MA Validation screen only shows MAs from the current season for the selected Country.</li><li>The Blocks tab per KPIN only shows current season blocks.</li><ul><br>[More technical details here](https://sparknz.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BIGDATA/pages/10421141698/Season+Rollover)
| Service Provider | A company that Zespri contracts with to do sampling or testing |
| Spray Diary | Source of information about blocks, orchards etc |
| SSP | Sampling Service Provider - collects fruit and delivers to the TSP |
| Supply Area | Where exactly this kiwifruit was grown |
| TR | Test result (e.g. “TR file”) |
| TSP | Testing Service Provider (a lab) - take the fruit from the SSP, test it and upload the resulting data to MCS via API |
| TZG | Taste Zespri Grade. Zespri pay incentive payments to growers for higher quality fruit. The measure of this is TZG which is worked out using the BRIX (sugar content) and Dry Matter values (within MCS). The higher the TZG, the higher the incentive payment to the grower. |
