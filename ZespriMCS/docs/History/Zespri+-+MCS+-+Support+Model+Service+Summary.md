## **Out of Scope:**

| :-: | :-: |
|*Service Requests – Complex*|Fulfilment of MCS Application Service Requests as defined requiring more than 8 hours of development will be serviced through a separate commercial arrangement from the project team. This is at the request of Zespri.|
|*Existing bugs and related incidents*|<p>Incidents as a result of existing known bugs are excluded from the scope of incident support within this agreement.</p><p>The development work required to resolve these types of Incidents will be delivered through a separate project.</p><p>At the agreement of both the Qrious SDM and the Zespri MCS Application owner, small bugs (such as cosmetic bugs), may be serviced under this MCS Application Support agreement.</p>|
|*Project bugs and new release related incidents*|<p>Incidents as a result of new releases or bugs under a Project, that require development work to resolve are excluded from the scope of incident support within this agreement.

|Capacity Management|Excluded from Scope|
|*Infrastructure & end-point device management*|Excluded from Scope|
|*Backups & recovery*|All software and system deployment code is backed up by Qrious in version-controlled Git repositories. There is currently no provision for data backup from the system or infrastructure. This is excluded from scope.|
|*Disaster recovery & business continuity*|The current cloud-based architecture provides for HA within the region it is deployed in. To our knowledge, the architecture does not support a cross-region failover, by design. This is excluded from scope.|
|*Untested features*|Support for incident resolution for untested or inadequately tested features (as per Zespri’s official testing procedures) in pre-production and production are excluded from scope. Qrious service governance will still provide assistance in triaging incidents and determining if an untested feature is the cause of the incident.|
|*Change management*|Excluded from scope. This is managed by Zespri.|
|*Third party management*|This is handled by Zespri. Qrious will support Zespri for triaging incidents. If after investigation, Qrious determine that an incident requires third- party intervention, the ownership of the ticket will be handed back to Zespri’s MCS Level 1/2 service desk.|
